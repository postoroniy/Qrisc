# Project Qrisc32 is RISC implementation

This cpu was implemented during of the course "Digital System Design" at Kyoung Hee University during my PhD earning.
Test bench runs 3 different sorting algorithms on qrisc32 and shows cycles for each turn. Data can be unsorted, already sorted or sorted in reverse order.
For observing instruction set, please refer to "risc_report.odp" file.
For running simulation you should have verilator, for synthesis yosys.
