    Project Qrisc32 is risc cpu implementation, purpose is studying "Digital Sy
stem Design" course at Kyoung Hee University during my PhD earning. Testbench
runs 3 different  sorting algorithms on qrisc32 and shows cycles for each turn.
For observing instruction set, please refer to "risc_report.odp" file.
For running simulation you should use qrisc32_TB.tcl in Modelsim.
